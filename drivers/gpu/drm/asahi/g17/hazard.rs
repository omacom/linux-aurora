//! Attachment overlap ordering across physical render pairs and shared images.
//! Tile stores can overlap even when the application's pixel regions do not.
//! Keep independent attachments concurrent; order only conflicting live spans.
//!
//! Within one VM, a render of another logical owner is ordered at publication:
//! the device mutex totally orders publications, and the later render's
//! fragment kick waits in firmware for the newest overlapping fragment kick of
//! every other pair. Admission never waits for such an overlap. Only a
//! cross-VM overlap through a shared object waits on the host for retirement,
//! so that one VM's fault can never hold another VM's kick in firmware.
