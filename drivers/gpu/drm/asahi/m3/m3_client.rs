//! Client admission: the M3 GPU runs AGX3 shaders and command streams. Userspace written for
//! the AGX2 GPUs (G13/G14) reads the M3's parameters as those of a G14 and would submit AGX2
//! streams, which fault the GPU; the M3 backends cannot recover from a fault, so one such client
//! stops the GPU for the rest of the boot. Userspace that drives the M3 knows the AGX3 fields
//! of `drm_asahi_params_global` (`usc_generation`, `gpu_hal_generation`) and asks GET_PARAMS
//! for at least the structure up to them; older userspace asks for less. On G15 a file therefore
//! has to ask for those fields before it can create a VM. Every path to the GPU needs a VM, so a
//! refused client can still query the parameters but never reaches the hardware.
